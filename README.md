# Squeak! [BETA]

_Squeak!_ lets you answer user questions, right in your docs. Even better: it lets your community support itself.

## Top features

- Embeds in any page of your docs or website
- Only questions asked on a specific page will appear
- Import Slack threads (from your community) and embed them on specific pages of your site (so they don't end up in the Slack abyss!)
- Your community benefits from shared knowledge, leading to fewer support requests and repeated questions

## About

Squeak! was created by [PostHog](https://posthog.com) out of a need to better support our own customers and move conversations out of our Slack community. Squeak! is open source under MIT.
