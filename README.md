# Build a community around your product with _Squeak!_ by PostHog.

_Squeak!_ is a toolkit for fostering a community in-house. It helps make discussions, resources, and solutions more accessible to the right people.

Learn more at [**squeak.posthog.com**](https://squeak.posthog.com) and star us to follow along.

Want to try it without installing? There's a [**cloud version of Squeak!**](https://squeak.cloud/signup) too.

## Toolkit
